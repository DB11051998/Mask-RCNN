# Mask-RCNN
Mask R-CNN is basically an extension of Faster R-CNN. Faster R-CNN is widely used for object detection tasks. For a given image, it returns the class label and bounding box coordinates for each object in the image.

The Mask R-CNN framework is built on top of Faster R-CNN. So, for a given image, Mask R-CNN, in addition to the class label and bounding box coordinates for each object, will also return the object mask.

Letâ€™s first quickly understand how Faster R-CNN works. This will help us grasp the intuition behind Mask R-CNN as well.

Faster R-CNN first uses a ConvNet to extract feature maps from the images
These feature maps are then passed through a Region Proposal Network (RPN) which returns the candidate bounding boxes
We then apply an RoI pooling layer on these candidate bounding boxes to bring all the candidates to the same size
And finally, the proposals are passed to a fully connected layer to classify and output the bounding boxes for objects

## Backbone Model
Similar to the ConvNet that we use in Faster R-CNN to extract feature maps from the image, we use the ResNet 101 architecture to extract features from the images in Mask R-CNN. So, the first step is to take an image and extract features using the ResNet 101 architecture. These features act as an input for the next layer.

## Region Proposal Network
Now, we take the feature maps obtained in the previous step and apply a region proposal network (RPM). This basically predicts if an object is present in that region (or not). In this step, we get those regions or feature maps which the model predicts contain some object.

## Region of interest(ROI)
The regions obtained from the RPN might be of different shapes, right? Hence, we apply a pooling layer and convert all the regions to the same shape. Next, these regions are passed through a fully connected network so that the class label and bounding boxes are predicted.

Till this point, the steps are almost similar to how Faster R-CNN works. Now comes the difference between the two frameworks. In addition to this, Mask R-CNN also generates the segmentation mask.

For that, we first compute the region of interest so that the computation time can be reduced. For all the predicted regions, we compute the Intersection over Union (IoU) with the ground truth boxes. We can computer IoU like this:

IoU = Area of the intersection / Area of the union
